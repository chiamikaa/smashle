This is a version of Word Master, but where all the answers are related to Smash Bros.

Heavily inspired by [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/).

Each guess can be any valid word.

After submitting a guess, the letters will turn gray, green, or yellow.

- Green: The letter is correct, in the correct position.
- Yellow: The letter is correct, but in the wrong position.
- Gray: The letter is incorrect.
